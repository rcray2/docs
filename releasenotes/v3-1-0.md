# New Features and Capabilities

## GlusterFS
GlusterFS is now used as the underlying storage platform, this provides performance improvements

**NOTE: This requires the infrastructure be provisioned differently**

## Monitoring Dashboards
Pre-configured dashboards for use with Grafana. URL is `http://<host name>:4000/`

## Log Aggregation
Service logs are now available through Graylog. URL is https://<host name>:8443/graylog/ui  


## Improved Error Handling

The user interface now provides better error handling, and offers more informative error messages.

## CLI Improvements
Multiple files can be uploaded through a mutation by specifying a directory path as the argument. Users can refresh the CLI authentication token with the mrefreshauth command. The CLI Readme file available in GitHub has been updated to include instructions around authentication.  

## System Services Names  
 System services are now identified by friendly names rather than GUID strings.

 System services can no longer be edited by users.

## Migration Paths
 3.1.0 sets a baseline system schema so that all subsequent Q platform releases will preserve previously created knowledge graphs and data.

## Kind Filter CKG boilerplate

In 3.0.5 managed services had following ways to get set of instances of a kind:

* AllX query that returns all instances of a given kind, including relations:

```bash
{
  allUsers {
    id name
    company { ceo { name }}
  }
}
```
* Xs query (e.g. wells) that returns instances given list of ids:

```bash
{
  users(ids: ["user1", "user5"] {
    id name
    company { ceo { name }}
  }
}
```

* Query and queryJSON that allows doing additional queries, but not to traverse relations or select only specific fields.

```bash
{
  queryJSON(input: {
    kindName: "Users",
    fieldFilters: [
      {
        fieldName: "country"
        op: "=="
        value: {ID: "Japan"}
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

**In 3.1.0 the XFilter query is introduced** to allow filtering of instances based on scalar field values, allowing traversing relations and selecting fields:
```bash
{
  userFilter(filters: [
      {
		# will accept either fieldName or fieldID
        fieldName: "country"
		# op accepts comparator values
        op: "=="
        # value provides the scalar type and value for your filter
        value: {ID: "Japan"}
      }
  ]) {
    id name
    company { ceo { name }}
  }
}
```
# Fixed Issues

|Fixes & Improvements|
| -----------|
| Improved handling of CLI upload timeouts. Mload mutation now provides a report of failures once it has completed running.  |
| Search no longer fails to return results on kinds where individual fields have been deleted.|
| It is now possible to re-add a service through the CLI without changing the name. This overwrites the previously added service.|
| UI improvements remove some of the more common workspace errors.|
| The execution of the extractAndLink mutation has been improved, and large tasks no longer prevent users from taking other actions.|
| Date fields now support adding instances with null/empty values. |
| Updated the naming convention for Relations to be proper graphQL camel case. |
| Fixed issue that was causing multiple documents kinds to be created when pdf files are added through the UI.|
| Field classifier service now sends properly batched request to the NER service.|
| Text extractor will now recognize when installed in a bad state (with regards to rabbitMQ) instead of continuing to run.|
| UI data preview now truncates text data at 200 characters, instead of trying to render large data and crashing.|
| Improved error handling with Text Extractor service - single failed event does not cause subsequent events to fail.|
| When files are added through the UI with a field labeled "id", Maana now recognizes that this should be treated as the identifier for kinds created from this file. **NOTE: If there are records with duplicate IDs, subsequent duplicate will update/overwrite the previous records so that each ID is unique.**|


# Known Issues


| Issue Description |
| -----------|
| It is a known issue that not all logs will show in in Graylog when a cluster is first deployed, as services may start before the Graylog server (stack) is completely up and running.  |
| Currently the ingestion process using CLI mutations does not perform well unless the batch size is set to more than 3000 per chunk, which can be set using the argument -b.|
| When large amounts of text data is added through the UI, the platform will become unresponsive. This is the result of the entity extractor bot performing a large number of writes to record the links to entities that it has found in the text. To prevent this, it is necessary to disable the entity extractor bot either by removing its instances `docker service scale <stack name>_maana-entity-extractor=0` or by commenting it out in Docker Compose file|
| Users can not currently truly delete instances of kinds from the graph through the UI, though it can be achieved using graphQL mutations.  |
| Certain events are not automatically recognized by the UI, and require the user to refresh to see the resultant changes. Uploading a CSV or Image requires a refresh before the hasKind or hasImage Links will be shown within the golden instance node that is created.|
| It is not possible to edit the type of a kind's field between certain classes of scalar if that kind is populated by instances. For example, if you have uploaded data to a kind that contains a field of type STRING, we do not currently support the action of changing that field to type FLOAT.|
| If you attempt to upload a large number of records containing bad data (such as badly formatted dates), there is a high-likelihood of system failure. Multiple errors will be raised by each bad record in the batch, and all of these will be thrown back to the loading client at once.  |
| For security reasons, we are currently not allowing services that are not deployed along with the Q platform to participate in the pub-sub network.  |
| The version of the CLI needs to be at least v3.1.0 to work correctly with v3.1.0 version of the Q platform. The CLI versions can be updated through the Maana Q github repository: [Maana Q github repository](https://github.com/maana-io/Q-cli/blob/master/README.md#to-build-and-install).|
