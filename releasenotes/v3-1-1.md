# New Features and Capabilities

## Entity Coocurrence Search  

This feature generalizes the ability to return the (co)occurrences (kind, field, instance, locations), given one or more kind instances (i.e., entities, and their surface forms) and an optional graph scope (kind, field, instance).

## Added 'take' parameter to Kind Queries  

Allows user to take all instances through boilerplate queries. Until now, this was only possible through queryJSON query. For allX queries, user was limited to 1000 results. Setting take parameter to -1 will return all instances of a given kind:

```bash
{ allPersons(take: -1) { id contactName }} #Take all instances of kind Person
{
  cityFilter(
    filters: {fieldName: "zipCode" op: "==" value: {INT: "98004"}}
    take: 5
  ) { name state country }
} # Take 5 cities with zip code 98004
```

## New join semantics for list fields.  

Join on a list field now denormalizes a kind, so following query is now possible - find all people that have address of WORK type:

```bash
{
  queryJSON(input: {
    kindName: "Person"
    and: [{
      kindName: "Address"
      fromFieldName: "addresses"
      toFieldName: "id"
      fieldFilters: [{
        fieldName: "addressType"
        op:"=="
        value: {STRING: "WORK"}
      }]
    }]
  })
}
```


## New 'anyof' operation  

New operation that allows filtering of list fields based on existence of elements in list field:

```bash
{
  personFilter(filters: {
    fieldName: "favoriteColors"
    op: "anyof"
    value: {l_STRING: ["red", "black"]}
  }) { id name favoriteColors }
} # Find all people who have either red or black as one of their favorite colors
```


## Distinct Projection and Aggregates

The platform now supports Projections and Aggregates via Kind Queries and queryJSON. See Kind Query example below:

```bash
# this query filters F1 race records by teamId = 2, and then returns the sum of all points earned through all races


Query foo{
  query(input: {
    kindName: "raceResult"
      fieldFilters: [{
        fieldName: "teamId"
        op:"=="
        value: {ID: "2"}     
      }]
   projection: [{
    fieldName: "points" # the query will return only the projected field from the Kind. "points" in this example. NOTE: in this example, this field is not needed as the output of the query will just be the SUM. See below.

    op: SUM # this aggregate op will return the total SUM of records. Other options are COUNT, MIN and MAX
   }]
    distinct: true # this is a BOOLEAN op that allows the user to return only the distinct records
    }
  )
  {
    records{
      INT # this determines what instances are returned from the Kind Query. In this example, INT will return the output of the SUM aggregate op
    }
  }
}
```
**Notes**
>Aggregate and non aggregate ops can't be mixed in a projection

> "queryJSON" boilerplate query works on very limited set of cases, please use "query" instead

> COUNT operation works on all types

> SUM, MIN and MAX operations work only on INT and FLOAT types


## Expire token on inactivity

Authentication currently auto renews as long as the browser window is open. This feature automates expiration of the token if the user has been inactive for a set amount of time (configurable with default set to 1hr).

## New rules for kind naming/validation  

Better error handling and rules around Kind naming, including: • Kinds imported from other services cannot be renamed • Kind names cannot be empty •Kind names are restricted to only valid GraphQL names [See Spec At](http://facebook.github.io/graphql/October2016/#sec-Names) • User cannot rename a Kind to the name of a Kind that already exists

## Categorical classification

Maana-fieldclassifier bot can now detect categorical data and surface as a suggested field type. Fields are classified as CATEGORICAL if there are fewer than 10% unique values in a field and the field is classified as MISC otherwise.




# Fixed Issues



| Fixes & improvements |
| -----------|
| In the query graph, the 'oneOf' filter query syntax is explained via text.  |
| Minor UI Improvement: Fixed issue that required the link icon (on a node in the knowledge graph) to be clicked twice to actually bring the kind into the KG.|
| Minor UI Improvement: Fixed issue where preview stretched uploaded image to fill horizontal window size. It now appropriately maintains original aspect ratio.
| Minor UI Improvement: Knowledge Application 'placeholder' tiles have been removed from the platform installation bootstrap process.|

# Known Issues


| Issue Description |
| -----------|
| It is a known issue that not all logs will show in in Graylog when a cluster is first deployed, as services may start before the Graylog server (stack) is completely up and running.|
| Currently the ingestion process using CLI mutations does not perform optimally unless the batch size is set to more than 3000 per chunk, which can be set using the argument -b.|
| When large amounts of text data is added through the UI, the platform will become unresponsive. This is the result of the entity extractor bot performing a large number of writes to record the links to entities that it has found in the text. To prevent this, it is necessary to disable the entity extractor bot either by removing its instances `docker service scale <stack name>_maana-entity-extractor=0` or by commenting it out in Docker Compose file. |
| Users cannot currently truly delete instances of kinds from the graph through the UI, though it can be achieved using graphQL mutations. |
| Certain events are not automatically recognized by the UI, and require the user to refresh to see the resultant changes. Uploading a CSV or Image requires a refresh before the hasKind or hasImage Links will be shown within the golden instance node that is created. |
| It is not possible to edit the type of a kind's field between certain classes of scalar if that kind is populated by instances. For example, if you have uploaded data to a kind that contains a field of type STRING, we do not currently support the action of changing that field to type FLOAT.|
| If you attempt to upload a large number of records containing bad data (such as badly formatted dates), there is a high-likelihood of system failure. Multiple errors will be raised by each bad record in the batch, and all of these will be thrown back to the loading client at once. |
| For security reasons, we are currently not allowing services that are not deployed along with the Q platform to participate in the pub-sub network. |
| The version of the CLI needs to be at least v3.1.0 to work correctly with v3.1.0 version of the Q platform. The CLI versions can be updated through the [Maana Q github repository](https://github.com/maana-io/Q-cli/blob/master/README.md#to-build-and-install) . |
