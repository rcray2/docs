# New Features and Capabilities

## HTTPS Encryption    

Maana now supports HTTPS encryption.       


## Authentication    

Maana Q now requires authentication for all clients that attempt to connect to the Q servers.

## Azure Storage Crawler Knowledge Service

We developed a service that allows users to crawl Azure File and Blob directories, to discover and build a file catalog of the contents.

## Text Extractor

We have added a service that extracts all textual information from files of type PDF, DOC, DOCX, PPT, PPTX, XLS, and XLSX, and makes it available in the kind associated with the file in Maana.

## Add Files by URL   

MIt is now possible to add a file to Maana through the UI by providing that file's URL, accessed using the "upload" icon in the Explorer tab of your workspace.

## New Query Graph Filters   

When using the Query Graph to filter a kind's instances based on field values, users are now able to use the logical arguments "is not equal to" and "is one of" in addition to the original "is equal to".

## Improved developer experience

Support giving services names, rather than relying on IDs, and support replacing services in-place rather than create new ones.  



# Fixed Issues

| Feature |
| -----------|
|Users now able to upload data sets with more than ~20k records using the CLI without receiving the "queryResult.forEach is not a function" error |
| Improvements in the in-node editing experience through the UI |
| Loading data through the CLI no longer throws a FieldMismatch error when the CSV being loaded has empty rows at the end |
| UI stability improvements |
| Improvements to the CKG interactions through CLI |
| Improvements to the Search feature in the UI |
| Proper handling of DateTime/Date types|


# Known Issues


| Issue Description |
| -----------|
| Upon deployment, it is possible for the text extractor service to start in a bad state and require a restart of that service. To restart the service, you can use the command: `docker service update {stack\_name}\_maana-text-extractor --force`  |
| Currently the ingestion process does not perform well unless the batch size (such as when using the CLI add mutations) is set to more than 3000 per chunk.|
| When large amounts of text data is added through the UI, the platform will become unresponsive. This is the result of the entity extractor bot performing a large number of writes to record the links to entities that it has found in the text. To prevent this, it is necessary to disable the entity extractor bot. |
| Users can not currently truly delete instances of kinds from the graph. This is because we have not yet implemented a way of allowing users to delete certain kinds without allowing them to also delete system kinds. |
| Certain events are not automatically recognized by the UI, and require the user to refresh to see the resultant changes. Uploading a CSV or Image requires a refresh before the HasKind or HasImage Links will be shown within the golden instance node that is created. |
| It is not possible to edit the type of a kind's field between certain classes of scalar, if that kind is populated by instances. For example, if you have uploaded data to a kind that contains a field of type STRING, we do not currently support the action of changing that field to type FLOAT. |
| If you attempt to upload a large number of records containing bad data (such as badly formatted dates), there is a high-likelihood of system failure. Multiple errors will be raised by each bad record in the batch, and all of these will be thrown back to the loading client at once. |
| As currently architected, services that are not deployed within the cluster containing the Maana platform are unable to access RabbitMQ, and as such are unable to participate in the pub-sub network. Planning a fix for v3.1.0. |
| The version of the CLI needs to be at least v1.0.36 to work correctly with v3.0.5.|
| All instances created in a single mutation must be created with a consistent structure (i.e. set of fields) or data will be lost. Fields without values must have an empty placeholder or empty value. |
