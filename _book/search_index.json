guide helps Analysts learn how to use the MAANA Knowledge Portal to create and explore knowledge graphs.\nWhat is Maana\nIn 2013 Maana invented a new way to represent industrial knowledge mathematically, using the Maana Patented Computational Knowledge Graph™. This unique technology enables industrial companies to encode human expertise and data from across silos into digital knowledge to help employees make better and faster decisions. The Maana Computational Knowledge Graph™ is a network of models that optimize specific operations and decisions flows by providing recommendations through AI-Driven Applications into those operations. This unique technology eliminates the need to move data and enables creation of thousands of models at scale, through the re-usability of models across the enterprise.\nNote: Used content from What is MAANA doc provide by Azita Feb 15, 2018.\nWhy Maana\nThe core of the Maana Knowledge Platform™ is its patented Computational Knowledge Graph™. The Maana Knowledge Graph is unique in several ways:\n\nUnlike traditional “semantic” systems, the Knowledge Graph does not rely exclusively on ontologies and description logics. Instead, the Knowledge Graph separates the structure of data from the content itself. This separation enables a fluidity of modeling, allowing data from any source and in any format to be seamlessly integrated, modeled, searched, analyzed, operationalized and re-purposed.\nThe data remains at the source and only the most relevant data in the context of what is being optimized is indexed and brought into the graph.\nEach resulting model is a unique combination of three key components – subject matter expertise, relevant data from silos, and the right algorithm – all of which are instrumental in optimizing assets and decision flows.\nThe Maana Computational Knowledge Graph is also dynamic. Nodes, which represent concepts in Maana’s graph are not static containers; they are computational vessels that allow for algorithms to be stored and executed. These algorithms could be as simple as pulling in new data from an external source, to as complicated as classification of documents through machine learning. As data is updated in real-time at the source, so are the nodes and the computational models that act on that data. This allows for far more complex relationships to be modeled, and facilitates the ability of the graph to understand the connections between concepts, rather than just strings in data. Ultimately this is used for optimizing decisions or operations.\nReusable Models\n\nThe flexibility of the Maana Knowledge Graph enables groups across the organization to leverage and build-upon models created by other groups, dramatically accelerating the speed at which models are created throughout the organization. These models are dynamic, and once operationalized into line-of-business applications, they learn and adapt based on the user’s behaviors and provide continuous intelligence for day-to-day operations.\nThe Maana Computational Knowledge Graph™ at the core of the platform is a network of models that are built using machine learning techniques and artificial intelligence that power AI-Driven Applications used to digitize decision support and operations.\nIt allows the knowledge of the business to be incrementally captured and grown, becoming more sophisticated as more projects are developed using it.\nThe MAANA knowledge platform offers a new way to get more out of machine learning and artificial intelligence projects and is the fastest way to digitize your business.\n2 Log in/out to Maana\n\nGo to the web address provided by IT admin.\nThe user can login using one of the 2 methods described below:\no Type user’s email address (if single sign-on (SSO) is enabled by IT) and click “Log in”\no Log in with a Google identity\nOnce logged in, the user can\n· add/change info on his profile (i.e name, add a picture, email address, etc)\n· choose between a Light or Dark portal theme\n· Log out\n\nTo log out, go to the top right section of the Maana screen, click on the Profile icon and select the Log out option\n3 MAANA Personal Dashboard (Home Tab)\nThe home screen of the MAANA portal has a few sections designed to help the user get faster to the activities that he/she is targeting.\n\nExample of the Home Screen / Dashboard\n3.1 Recent items\nThe recent items section is populated automatically by the system with the most recent items that the Business Analyst interacted with.\n3.2 Favorite items\nFavorite items section is populated with items that the Business Analyst marked as “Favorite” in the Context Panel area of the workspace (insert hype link to . See  to learn how to make an item as Favorite.\nThe items that can be added to the Favorites list can be raw data kinds, kinddb, others… (exhaustive list tbd)\n3.3\n· what can i add to my Favorites and how do I do it?\n· can i edit my Favorites list and delete favs from there?\n3.4 Activity Feed\n· what goes in the activity feed?\n· any catalogue additions? what is considered a catalogue addition?\n· kind additions to the KGs the user has access within a namespace.\n· are there any settings I can change as user? need a way to make the activity feed relevant for my role.\n4 Workspaces\n4.1 What is a workspace\nA workspace is a dedicated place within the MAANA portal where a user can build, visualize and explore computational knowledge graph.\nThe Maana portal home page features a tab called “Workspaces”, where the user can find:\n· “My Workspaces” – workspaces that he/she created previously\n· “Shared Workspaces” – workspaces that multiple users share\n· “Workspace Templates” – can be used to create a new workspace from an existing template\n\nExample of workspace\n4.2 Shared workspaces\nOnce a workspace is created it will automatically be saved and will appear under “My workspaces” in the “Workspaces” tab. The user can share the workspace only with other users within the same tenant.\n\nTo share a workspace (proposal):\n· Right-click on the workspace name and select the “Sharing…” option.\n· Type the email addresses of the users you would like to add and then click “Share”\nTo remove a user from a shared workspace:\n· Right-click on the workspace name and select the “Sharing…” option.\n· Type the email addresses of the users you would like to remove from sharing and click “Remove Sharing”\n4.3 Workspace Templates\nNote: this is a proposal. Workspace templates not implemented yet.\nUsing workspace templates can speed up building knowledge solutions as they may come with ready built knowledge graphs, kinds, micro-services, etc.\nTo create a workspace template:\n· Go to “My workspaces” in the “Workspaces” tab\n· Right click on a workspace and select “Make Template“\n· Click Yes on the confirmation message that appears\nThe newly created workspace template will appear in the Templates section. You can further share the template with other users within the same tenant by right-clicking on a template, selecting the “Sharing…“ option and adding the users you want the template to be shared with.\n4.4 How to create/delete a workspace\nTo create a new workspace:\n· Click on the “Workspaces” tab at the top of the Maana portal\n· Click on the “+” on the top right of the new menu ribbon that appears. A new workspace with the name “Untitled” is created.\n· To rename the newly created workspace edit the “Name” field in the Context Panel appearing on the right side of the screen, then scroll down to the bottom of the Context Panel and click the Save icon ().\nTo delete a workspace:\n· The user can only delete workspaces that he/she created.\n· Click on the “Workspaces” tab at the top of the Maana portal\n· Right click on the workspace you wish to delete and select the “Delete” option\n· The system will display a message asking for confirmation. Click “Yes” to confirm deletion.\nCaution: deleting a workspace may impact applications, services and users connected to it. Contact your Maana platform admin or Maana customer support to understand the impact before deleting workspaces. The Maana platform admin can also delete a workspace following a request from end-user.\n4.5 How to open/close an existing workspace\nTo open an existing workspace:\n· Go to “Workspaces” tab in the top horizontal menu of and click on a workspace from My Workspaces, a shared workspace from the Shared Workspaces group, or a template from the Workspace Templates group.\nNote: The secondary ribbon menu in the under the WORKSPACES tab shows the workspaces that are currently open. Clicking on any of the names will take the user to the respective workspace.\n\nTo close an existing workspace:\n· Got the “Workspaces” tab in the top horizontal menu of and click on a workspace name in the secondary horizontal menu to select it, then click on the minus sign (insert ) to the right of the list of workspace names.\n4.6 Working within a workspace\nThe workspace features several areas with specific functionality that enables the user to create, manage, visualize and explore Knowledge Graphs and their components\n\n4.6.1 Explorer Panel\n4.6.2\nThe Explorer Panel allows the user to\n· Create/clone a new Knowledge Graph\n· Query a Knowledge Graph\n· Upload a file or a group of files to create or enhance a knowledge graph\n· Create a new Query\n4.6.3\n4.6.4 The Canvas\nThe Canvas enables the user to\n· Drag and Drop files to create/enhance a knowledge graph\n· Create/Delete kinds\n· Curate existing kinds and the connections between them.\n· Visualize and manually explore the Knowledge Graph\n\nCanvas example.\n4.6.5 The Context Panel\nThe Context Panel has a few tabs enables the user to\n· Information Tab () -\no Modify Kinds and their properties\no Delete or remove Kinds from the Knowledge Graph\n· Relations Tab () – used to create relations between Kinds or entities within Kinds\n· Text mining tab (Doc Assist®)  - Used for document classification.\n· Filtering tab - ???\n· Other tab- ???\n4.6.6\n4.6.7\n4.6.8\n4.6.9 The Inventory Panel\nThe Inventory Panel contains an inventory of micro services and files, kinds used in the workspace.\n4.6.10\n4.6.11 The Visualization Panel\n4.6.12\nThe Visualization Panel allows the user to visualize kinds and data associated with those kinds like instances, entities and values.\nRaw Data kinds can be explored quickly using the visualization panel as each entity detected in the data file can be filtered using a “search as you type” capability\n\nNote Marius: what about interpreted kinds? Do we still have the same filtering capability ? at some point?\nThe visualization panel can also be used to query a knowledge graph using GraphQL.\n\n5 Platform capabilities\n5.1 What is a Computational Knowledge Graph\nThe Maana Computational Knowledge Graph™ (CKG) is a network of models that optimize specific operations and decisions flows by providing recommendations through AI-Driven Applications into those operations. This unique technology eliminates the need to move data and enables creation of thousands of models at scale, through the re-usability of models across the enterprise.\nAn example of a CKG is a knowledge graph containing a networks of models describing the oil wells dug in the Gulf of Mexico during the last 50 years, including companies, people, equipment and activities involved, etc.\n5.2 Key components of a CKG\nBefore creating a working CKG, it is useful to gain a basic understanding of a few notions that will help the user make most out of the MAANA portal experience.\nTerm\nWhat is it?\nExample\nKinds\nKinds are concepts.\nExamples: People, Ships, Oil Wells, Invoices\nFields/ Entities\nEntities are properties within a certain concepts\nExamples of entities related to the People concept: age, sex, height, weight, etc.do we need this?\nInstances\nA particular set of values for entities within a concept.\nExample of an instance: Paul, 40yrs old, male, 6', 180poundsExamples of entities related to the People concept: age, sex, height, weight, etc.\nValues\nA particular size, measure, number of an entity\nExample of a value: 40Example of an instance: Paul, 40yrs old, male, 6', 180pounds\nRelations\nConnections /dependencies that can be established between fields belonging to different Kinds\nExample: A Kind describing an oil well may contain a field of type String showing the name of the company operating that well. That field has a relation with the Kind containing Company Names\nMicroservice / Bot\n· Microservices are processes that communicate with each other over a network in order to fulfill a goal using technology-agnostic protocols such as HTTP.\n·\n· They are organized around capabilities, e.g., user interface front-end, recommendation, logistics, billing, etc.\nMicroservices can emit events (act as publishers) which trigger automatic action(s) from other services (acting as subscribers) that react to those events.\nMicroservices are small in size, independently deployable and easy to replace.\n.\nExamples:\nio.maana.nlp service category\nNamed entity recognition (NER) microservice\nDoc classification\nio.maana**.miner**\nField classifier\nString\nString is any arbitrary length character sequence and is the most generic representation (i.e. it has little meaning).\n·\nKnowledge Accelerator Tip: check out our short Tutorial (link to Tutorial doc) with a specific, dataset-driven example on how you can create and explore a CKG. It will help you move much faster when you will create the first CKG from your own data!\n5.3 Loading structured data into MAANA\nTo load structured data into Maana:\n\nCreate or select the workspace where you want to load data. Go to “Workspaces” Tab and either create a workspace or open a Shared Workspace/Template ( see 4.4 and/or 4.5 for more details if needed).\nClick the “upload file” button then select the file(s) you would like to add. You can also drag and drop files into the Canvas area to upload them into the current workspace. The platform currently supports the CSV file format, with more file types to be supported in the near future.\n\n\nThe uploading file(s) will appear on the canvas while a “Progress” indicator in the explorer tab shows that the file is being processed.\n\nFollowing the completion of the upload process, the system will generate:\n\nRaw Data Kind(s) – data kind representing files that were uploaded into Maana and their corresponding metadata.\n\n\nExample of Raw Data Kind\n\nInterpreted Kind(s)– kinds generated from the Raw Data Kind following parsing by Maana bots/microservices.\n\nLoading data into a Raw Data Kind triggers automatic parsing by Maana bots, resulting in the creation of o Interpreted Kind and possibly other subsequent kinds (People Names, Company, etc) and connections between them, including:\n· Field classifications: interpretations of individual fields and their values against known Kinds and instances (e.g., People, Places, Organizations, Categorical). For example the field classifier bot can suggest that an entity called “Company name” is of type “Company”, where Company is a known kind describing companies doing business in the US).\n· Entity extraction: analysis of comments, descriptions, or whole documents to identify mentions of entities, values, and facts\n\nThe interpreted kinds have a schemas that includes entities that make up that kind and their suggested field types, which can be detected by Maanaa field classifier microservice as generic field types ( ie String, Integer, etc) or as kind types\n\nExample: Interpreted Kind appears in blue, with sample instances showing in the visualization tab.\n\nRelations between kinds - Maana suggested relations and/or dependencies within the associative network. The Business Analyst can review and validate them as part of the kind visualization and curation process.\n\n\nMaana also offers the option to load multiple files via CLI. See section “5.9 CLI capabilities” for instructions.\n5.4 Loading unstructured data into MAANA\nThe user can load unstructured data files into MAANA following the same process as for structured data:\n\nCreate or select the workspace where you want to load data. Go to “Workspaces” Tab and either create a workspace or open a Shared Workspace/Template ( see 4.4 and/or 4.5 for more details if needed)\nClick the “Upload file” button, select the desired file(s). You can also drag and drop files into the Canvas area to upload them into the current workspace. The platform currently supports the TXT and PDF text file formats, with additional file types to be supported in the near future.\n\nHowever, when unstructured data files are loaded, there are additional bots/microservices that mine the data:\n· Entity extraction: analysis of comments, descriptions, or whole documents to identify mentions of entities, values, and facts\nThe extracted entities will appear in the Inventory Tab, under the MAANA Entity Extractor service together with information how many instances of such entities were identified. The Business Analyst can drag one or all of the extracted entities to the canvas making them Kinds within the Knowledge Graph.\n\n· Text classification: classification of comments, descriptions, or whole documents into preferred groups (e.g. Comment problem types - Stuck pipe, Waiting on weather, etc. or document types - AFE report or Lease agreement) – not available yet in UI.\n5.5 Create, Delete or Rename a Kind\ntba\n5.6 Visualize kinds\n5.7\nMaana Kinds appear in 2 different shapes within the CKG canvas: Compact and Expanded\nCompact Representation of an interpreted kind\n\nThe Compact representation of a kind includes the following elements:\n· Kind name\n· IN – relations connector at the kind level - shows incoming relations into the kind.\n\nExample: IN-relation connector at the kind level.\n· OUT- relations connector at the kind level - shows outgoing relations / dependencies TO other kinds\n\nExample: OUT-relation connector at the kind level.\n· Down-arrow – clicking on the down arrow changes the representation of the kind from Compact mode to the Expanded mode.\nExpanded Representation–\n\nThe Expaded representation of a kind includes the following elements:\n· Kind name\n· IN – relations connector at the kind level - shows incoming relations into the kind.\n· OUT- relations connector at the kind level - shows outgoing relations / dependencies TO other kinds\n· List of entities within that kind.\n· IN – relations connector at the entity level - shows incoming relations into the kind or entities within those kinds.\n· \n· OUT- relations connector at the entity level - shows outgoing relations / dependencies TO other kinds or entities within those kinds\n\n· Up-arrow – clicking on the up arrow changes the representation of the kind from Expanded mode to the Compact mode.\nThe user can cycle between the 2 different representations of the kind using the arrow at the bottom of the arrow. The way the kind is presented in the canvas space does not affect its functionality.\nTo visualize a kind, you need to bring in in focus first. That can be done by\n· clicking on the kind in the canvas space\n· selecting the kind from the list in the Explorer panel or the Inventory panel\nIn the bottom panel under the canvas, the user can\n· preview the kind\n· view a summary of a\nWhile building or querying graphs, as a user, I need to have the ability to visualize its components (Kinds, Queries, Files) at all times.

Our mission is to facilitate the tens of millions of experts working in industrial companies around the world, and give them the ability to make better decisions, faster. We are devoted to putting the power of artificial intelligence (AI) into the hands of millions of industry experts, offering enhanced decision-making tools in a rapid response environment.\nBetter and Faster\nIn 2013 Maana invented a new way to represent industrial knowledge mathematically, using the Maana Patented Computational Knowledge Graph™. This unique technology enables industrial companies to encode human expertise and data from across silos into digital knowledge, eliminating the need to move data and enabling the creation of thousands of models at scale, through the re-usability of models across the enterprise.\nScope\nThis guide is intended for the use of Solution Developers and Data Scientists, and describes how to develop such services (aka \"bots\") and applications and operationalize them in a production setting.\nGlossary\nPrior to working with the Maana Platform, it is suggested that you familiarize yourself with some basic terms and concepts that will help the make most out of your Maana portal experience. For a complete Glossary of Terms, please refer to the Appendix found at the back of this document.\nThe Maana Platform\nThe Maana platform is used by solutions teams to deliver knowledge applications to their end users (i.e., business users, SMEs, managers). This “solution team” approach involves the collaboration of analysts, engineers, and data scientists. The platform is designed to build an enterprise-wide knowledge layer, utilizing search and exploration for solution development and delivery.\nThe Computational Knowledge Graph\nAt the core of any Maana solution sits our Computational Knowledge Graph (CKG), a network of models built using machine learning techniques and artificial intelligence that powers AI-driven applications used to digitize decision support and operations. It allows the knowledge of the business to be incrementally captured and grown, evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated as more projects are developed.\nUtillizing GraphQL\nMaana uses GraphQL to represent and expose its Computational Knowledge Graph. GraphQL is a data query language created by Facebook and open-sourced in 2015 as an alternative to REST interfaces.\nGraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in the API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools. With the GraphQL type system, the developers can access the full capabilities of your data from a single endpoint.\nGraphQL creates a uniform API across your entire application without being limited by a specific storage engine. The developer provides functions for each field in the type system, and GraphQL calls them with optimal concurrency.\nMaana Platform Architecture and GraphQL\n\nFor more information on using on Graph QL, please refer to the link provided below:\nComputational Knowledge Graph Features\nWith the Computational Knowledge Graph:\n•   The Graph is dynamic. Nodes, which represent concepts in the graph, are not static containers, but rather act as computational vessels, allowing algorithms to be stored and executed.\nWith the Computational Knowledge Graph:\n\nThe structure of data is separated from its content. This separation enables a fluidity of modeling - data from any source or format can be seamlessly integrated, modeled, searched, analyzed, operationalized and re-purposed.\nData remains at the source - Only the most relevant data, within the context of what is being optimized, is indexed and brought into the graph.\nEach resulting Data Model is a unique combination of three key components, which are instrumental in optimizing assets and decision flows:\n\nNote:  These algorithms might range from being as simple as pulling in new external source data, to as complicated as classification of documents through machine learning.\n\nAs source data is updated in real time, so are the nodes and the computational models that act on that data, permitting more complex relationships to be modeled, and enhancing the graph’s ability to understand the connections between concepts (rather than simple strings of data), and encouraging optimization of decisions and operations.\n\nThe CKG consists of concepts and properties, instances and values, and relations and links.\nConsider the concept of a ContainerShip with the properties of name, length, position, etc. A specific instance (entity) for our ContainerShip might have values for each of these properties, such as the vessel Maersk Viking having a length of 400 meters. Such properties can be scalar (e.g., numbers, strings, dates) or might refer to other concepts/instances - such as the Hold Cargo of the vessel.\nIn some cases, property values for an instance may simply be stored, as they are rarely subject to change. In other cases, they will be dynamically computed, due to constantly changing values - such as a ship's weight (which is dependent upon its cargo) or variables like the vessel’s current position (which requires getting a GPS reading).\nUnlike a traditional graph database, Maana incorporates arbitrary computation (through custom GraphQL resolvers) and distributes the graph into subgraphs managed by different microservices, optionally with their own dedicated persistence mechanism. This separation enables a fluidity of modeling, allowing data from any source and in any format to be seamlessly integrated, modeled, searched, analyzed, operationalized and re-purposed. It also places more responsibility on the microservices to provide their own storage.\nData Split\nTo address this, Maana proposes an explicit split between the data models (i.e., GraphQL type definitions) that a service uses and its operations (i.e., GraphQL resolvers). Maana will generate the appropriate managed service for such models using KindDB, Prisma, neo4j, etc. With this, the solution developer only provides the logic they care about and let the system take care of all the CRUD/ORM-like operations on the data.\nKnowledge Microservices\nKnowledge microservices are a class of GraphQL services that are developed for the Maana platform. Unlike pure client-server or n-tier architectures, Maana's microservices act as peers in an asynchronous and loosely-coupled arrangement that promotes independent scaling and extensibility. They provide identity and access controls, graph persistence, search, machine learning, and natural language processing.\nAs a consequence, these peer microservices provide reasoning capabilities to Knowledge Applications, which help solve domain-specific problems and support optimal decision-making that is capable of learning over time. Taken together, these services allow the solution developer to focus on designing GraphQL schemas and implementing computational resolvers only where needed.\nThe Maana platform manages these services, providing authentication, reliable messaging, (automatic) graph persistence (with search and querying), scaling, monitoring, and a rich UX. These GraphQL services include:\n\nauthenticated access\nclient/server boilerplate\nreliable messaging using RabbitMQ\nlifecycle management (info, register, deregister)\nDocker containerization and automatic scaling/load balancing\n\nMaana Knowledge Services form a network of GraphQL endpoints, exposing their types, queries, and mutations for direct access, as well as publishing and subscribing to network events. A GraphQL service (or endpoint) consists of:\n\ntypes\nqueries\nmutations\nevents (pub/sub)\n\nExamples of knowledge microservices include:\nThe Maana platform is built from a network of GraphQL-based microservices.

These services provide identity and access controls, graph persistence, search, machine learning, and natural language processing. Ultimately, these services provide reasoning capabilities to Knowledge Applications, which help solve domain-specific problems and support optimal decision-making capable of learning over time.\nThis guide is intended for Solution Developers and Data Scientists and describes how to develop such services (aka \"bots\") and applications and operationalize them in a production setting.\nGraphQL and Microservices\nAt the core of any Maana solution sits a Knowledge Graph, which consists of concepts and properties, instances and values, and relations and links. For example, consider the concept of a ContainerShip with properties name, length, position, etc. A specific instance (entity) has values for each of the properties, such as the Maersk Viking with a length of 400 meters, ... Such properties can be scalar (e.g., numbers, strings, dates) or might refer to other concepts/instances, e.g., ships hold Cargo. In some cases, property values for an instance are simply stored, since they don't change (often). In other cases, they are dynamically computed, such as a ship's weight (which depends on its cargo) or its current position (which requires getting a GPS reading).\nGraphQL is a data query language created by Facebook and open-sourced in 2015 as an alternative to REST interfaces. Maana uses GraphQL to represent and expose its Knowledge Graph\nUnlike a traditional graph database, Maana incorporate arbitrary computation (through custom GraphQL resolvers) and distributes the graph into subgraphs managed by different microservices, optionally with their own dedicated persistence mechanism.\nWhile this approach allows for flexibility, it places more responsibility on the microservices to provide their own storage.

Maana will generate the appropriate managed service for such models using KindDB, Prisma, neo4j, ... The solution developer, then, only provides the logic they care about and let the system take care of all the CRUD/ORM-like operations on the data.\nThe Computational Knowledge Graph (CKG), itself a microservice, provides automatic persistence, boilerplate queries and mutations, and service orchestration capabilities. Taken together, these service allow the solution developer to focus on designing GraphQL schemas and implementing computational resolvers only where needed.\nGraphQL Learning Resources\n\nHow to GraphQL\n\nKnowledge Microservices and Bots\nA GraphQL service (endpoint) consists of:\n\ntypes\nqueries\nmutations\nevents (pub/sub)\n\nA Knowledge Microservice is a GraphQL service that also includes:\n\nauthenticated access\nclient/server boilerplate\nreliable messaging using RabbitMQ\nlifecycle management (info, register, deregister)\nDocker containerization and automatic scaling/load balancing\n\nA Bot is a Knowledge Microservice that provides specialized queries and mutations that perform BotActions, which allow the bot to provide asynchronous status updates. This enables user interface components to reflect the latest status of long-running operations or automatically triggered events, e.g., entity recognition, new concept creation, classification.\nAll Kinds (concepts, types) are associated with a service. This service is said to provide the (entities of) the Kind. Many Kinds are purely extensional (i.e., data) and do not have custom CRUD behavior. Such Kinds are automatically managed by CKG and stored in the KindDB, where it will be indexed for efficient search and querying (including sophisticated entity cooccurrences).\nServices also depend on existing Kinds and queries, mutations, and events. The services that provide these Kinds (which may be fully managed by CKG/KindDB) can be imported into a new service purely through GraphQL and specified in a manifest that is used to create and register a new service. This process will result in a merged schema on a service-specific endpoint that the newly developed service uses for all Maana GraphQL communication (non-pub/sub).\nDevelopment Stages\n\nDesign: focus on GraphQL types (Kinds, Properties, Relations), queries and mutations (often based on Problem Questions), and events (consumed and produced)\nLocal Service (Standalone): choose programming language, identify dependencies (libraries, existing services and domain models), core logic to satisfy GraphQL interface contract\nLocal Service (Maana): continue local development, connecting to a remote Maana deployment (e,g, Azure) to consume and produce GraphQL other services via your custom endpoint\nUnmanaged Service: deploy your service via your own means (e.g., Heroku), but make it accessible to Maana to communicate to for call and event dispatching\nManaged Service: Dockerize your service and make it available in a registry that Maana has access to (e.g., Azure)\n\nThe following sections will elaborate on each of these stages.\nStage: Design\nAt this point, the overall problem to be solved has been analyzed and a domain model and set of decomposed problem questions has been generated, some discussion of entity sources and data science has taken place, and it is now time to code one or more Knowledge Microservices to provide some new concepts (types, Kinds) along with queries, mutations, and events that involve them.\nFocus on the GraphQL. This is the entire description of and interface to the world for the Knowledge service/bot. Define the GraphQL SDL a file, e.g., `model.gql`, including custom queries, mutations, and publications/subscriptions. Plan the custom resolvers, i.e., what is their core logic?\nStage: Local Service (Standalone)\nWith at least an initial design complete, the following implementation decisions must be made:\n\nAre there existing Kinds and Services that can be reused?\nAre their existing code libraries or ML models that can be reused?\nWhat is the best programming language for this task?\nIs there reference data or domain data?\nAre there long-running tasks?\nWhat are the scale, performance, and capacity factors?\n\nOnce a programming language has been chosen, then an existing project template can be used to scaffold a new Knowledge Microservice/Bot in Scala/JVM, Python, JavaScript, ...\nDevelopment of core logic or machine learning solution happens as it normally would, writing, testing, and debugging code or improving model accuracy.\nThe Knowledge Service is a standard GraphQL endpoint, so it can be run and tested within the development environment and used via Maana CLI, its own exposed GraphiQL, a standalone GraphQL Playground, etc.\nDependent types and services are imported into the service model using a modified version of a technique from graphql-import:\n# import File, Url, MimeType from io.maana.core @PASSTHRU\n\ninput CrawlOptions {\n  url: Url\n  ...\n}\n\n\n...\n\n\ntype Mutation {\n  crawl(input: CrawlOptions): BotAction\n  ...\n}\n\nStage: Local Service (Maana)\nIn the previous stage, it is likely that various calls/services were stubbed or mocked because they required accessing a Maana cluster. It is now time to interact with a Maana deployment, typically one dedicated to development.\nCommunication to a Maana system requires the use of authentication. This is configured differently, based on the language/framework being used. Refer to the project template documentation used to scaffold the Knowledge service project.\nThe service being development must be registered with Maana. This is typically done programmatically using the Maana CLI by specifying a manifest that describes the service and its dependencies. For example:\n{\n  id: \"io.maana.azure.crawler\",\n  name: \"Maana Azure Storage Crawler Service\",\n  dockerRegistry: null,\n  hostedUrl: null,\n}\n\nThe result of registering a new service with Maana is that CKG will generate a dedicated service endpoint for the new service, e.g., https://knowledge.acme.com/service/io.maana.azure.crawler:7331. This enables the standalone service to communicate to Maana, but does not allow Maana to dispatch calls to the standalone service due to network connectivity restrictions. (This will be overcome in the next stages.)\nThe full GraphQL schema for a service manifest is:\n# from io.maana.system\ntype ServiceManifest {\n  id: ID!\n  name: String\n  description: Text\n  registeredOn: DateTime\n  registeredBy: User\n  dockerRegistry: Url\n  hostedUrl: Url\n  modelSdl: String\n}\n\nStage: Unmanaged Service\nWhen it is time to have full participation in the Maana processing network, i.e., having its endpoint services consumed by other services, user interfaces, or automatically based on event subscription, then Maana's CKG must be able to communicate to the service. This means that the service must itself be deployed to a host that is accessible from the Maana cluster, e.g., Heroku, Azure, AWS, on-premise. In this configuration, the service owner is responsible for deploying, monitoring, scaling, securing, etc. the service, since Maana only has knowledge of a GraphQL endpoint URL and the schema it provides.\nSee the Deploy to Heroku tutorial.\nStage: Managed Service\nMaana can completely manage a containerized Knowledge Microservice/Bot, by specifying a Docker registry that the Maana deployment has access to (e.g., DockerHub, Azure).

This unique technology enables industrial companies to encode human expertise and data from across silos into digital knowledge to help employees make better and faster decisions. The Maana Computational Knowledge Graph™ is a network of models that optimize specific operations and decisions flows by providing recommendations through AI-Driven Applications into those operations. This unique technology eliminates the need to move data and enables creation of thousands of models at scale, through the re-usability of models across the enterprise.\nWhy MAANA\nThe core of the Maana Knowledge Platform™ is its patented Computational Knowledge Graph™. The Maana Knowledge Graph is unique in several ways:\n\nUnlike traditional \"semantic\" systems, the Knowledge Graph does not rely exclusively on ontologies and description logics. Instead, the Knowledge Graph separates the structure of data from the content itself. This separation enables a fluidity of modeling, allowing data from any source and in any format to be seamlessly integrated, modeled, searched, analyzed, operationalized and re-purposed.\nThe data remains at the source and only the most relevant data in the context of what is being optimized is indexed and brought into the graph.\nEach resulting model is a unique combination of three key components – subject matter expertise, relevant data from silos, and the right algorithm – all of which are instrumental in optimizing assets and decision flows.\nThe Maana Computational Knowledge Graph is also dynamic. Nodes, which represent concepts in Maana's graph are not static containers; they are computational vessels that allow for algorithms to be stored and executed. These algorithms could be as simple as pulling in new data from an external source, to as complicated as classification of documents through machine learning. As data is updated in real-time at the source, so are the nodes and the computational models that act on that data. This\n\nallows for far more complex relationships to be modeled, and facilitates the ability of the graph to understand the connections between concepts, rather than just strings in data. Ultimately this is used for optimizing decisions or operations.\n\nReusable Models\n\nThe flexibility of the Maana Knowledge Graph enables groups across the organization to leverage and build-upon models created by other groups, dramatically accelerating the speed at which models are created throughout the organization. These models are dynamic, and once operationalized into line-of-business applications, they learn and adapt based on the user's behaviors and provide continuous intelligence for day-to-day operations.\nThe Maana Computational Knowledge Graph™ at the core of the platform is a network of models that are built using machine learning techniques and artificial intelligence that power AI-Driven Applications used to digitize decision support and operations.\nIt allows the knowledge of the business to be incrementally captured and grown, becoming more sophisticated as more projects are developed using it.\nThe MAANA knowledge platform offers a new way to get more out of machine learning and artificial intelligence projects and is the fastest way to digitize your business.\n\n\n1.2.Maana platform architecture and GraphQL\n\n\n\nMaana platform architecture\n\nInsert paragraph on Maana platform architecture components – ask Donald where can you get the content from.\nMAANA platform is using GraphQL, a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling queries with data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in the API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.\nWith the GraphQL type system, the developers can access the full capabilities of your data from a single endpoint.\nGraphQL creates a uniform API across your entire application without being limited by a specific storage engine. The developer provides functions for each field in the type system, and GraphQL calls them with optimal concurrency.\n\n\n1.3.About Maana Kinds and other useful terms\n\n\n\nBefore creating a working computational knowledge graph and, it is useful to gain a basic understanding of a few notions that will help the user make most out of the MAANA portal experience.\n\n\n\nTerm\nWhat is it?\nExample\n\n\n\n\nKinds\nKinds are concepts.\nExamples: People, Ships, Oil Wells, Invoices\n\n\nFields\nFields are properties within a certain concept\nExamples of fields related to the People concept: age, sex, height, weight, etc.do we need this?\n\n\nInstances\nA particular set of values for entities within a concept.\nExample of an instance: Paul, 40yrs old, male, 6', 180poundsExamples of entities related to the People concept: age, sex, height, weight, etc.\n\n\nValues\nA particular size, measure, number of an entity\nExample of a value: 40Example of an instance: Paul, 40yrs old, male, 6', 180pounds\n\n\nRelations\nConnections /dependencies that can be established between fields belonging to different Kinds\nExample: A Kind describing an oil well may contain a field of type String showing the name of the company operating that well. That field has a relation with the Kind containing Company Names\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.Knowledge Microservices\n\n\n\nKnowledge microservices are a class of microservices that are developed for the MAANA platform.\nMaana Knowledge Services form a network of GraphQL endpoints, exposing their types, queries, and mutations for direct access, as well as publishing and subscribing to network events. The Maana platform manages these services, providing authentication, reliable messaging, (automatic) graph persistence (with search and querying), scaling, monitoring, and a rich UX.\nExamples of knowledge microservices include:\n\n\n\nIndexers • Text• Number• Time• Geospatial• Geometric\nMiners • Statistics• Probabilities• NER/NLP\nClassifiers • Entity• Field• Document• Image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowledge Services can become Knowledge \"Bots\" by offering and using \"bot actions,\" which allows the service to interact more directly to users.\nUsers can configure, start, stop, and schedule bot actions. Services can report on status and progress for potentially long-running, asynchronous operations, as well as report any errors or messages. Bots are microservices that \"listen\" for specific events on a system bus – Maana uses RabbitMQ for system bus – and act automatically when such events happen to mine and enrich the graph (i.e. when a raw data file is loaded into MAANA, a bot automatically analyzes it to identify mentions of entities like persons, phone numbers, values, and facts).\nThere are two primary scenarios to consider here: event handling and direct query/mutation.\n\nEvent Handling\n\nWhen a Knowledge Service subscribes to and handles an event, such as \"fileAdded,\" it can (optionally) create an instance of a BotAction Kind by mutating the CKG. As the service performs its operation, it can periodically update the progress (if it is deterministic) and update the status and report errors.\n\nQueries and Mutations\n\nA user can invoke a query or mutation either explicitly (e.g., train a classifier on labeled data) or implicitly (i.e., as part of query graph). In such cases, the service exposes such queries and mutations as returning a BotAction.\n\n\n1.5.Knowledge Applications\n\n\n\nKnowledge Applications are applications that are built on top of the Maana CKG to help subject matter experts make better decisions faster.\nA Knowledge application presents a custom interface to the end user and optimizes interaction for most common actions.\nGenerally a knowledge application generally provides the following functionality:\n\nAllow user to specify question inputs\nGenerate recommendations\nVisualize recommendations and rationale\nAllow user to explore and tune inputs\nAccept user decision\n\nKnowledge applications can be developed in any language. Most languages have some level of GraphQL support.\n\n\n1.6.MAANA catalogue\n\n\n\nMaana catalogue is the repository for all components that can be used as part of MAANA knowledge solutions\n\nHow do you add/publish/update/delete components in the catalogue?\n2.Defining a model in Maana\n\nAll of the following documentation uses XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX facing to represent the public URL of the system. All of the following examples use the Graphiql endpoint which is interactive, programmatic access conducted through the Graphql endpoint.\nGraphQL API is organized around three main building blocks: the schema, queries, and resolvers.\nQueries can be executed via GET or POST, with either the body of the query as the query string or in the body of the POST. All mutations must use the POST endpoint and have the header content type set to application/json. Also, the GraphQL server needs a resolver to know what to do with an incoming query.\n\n    _Anatomy of a GraphQL Query (_ [_source_](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/the-anatomy-of-a-graphql-query-6dffa9e9e747)_)_\n\nThe following is an example of how to create a graph with no mutation specified, using the cURL command line tool for getting or sending files using URL syntax.\ncurl -v -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X POST -d \"{\\\"query\\\": \\\"mutation { ..... }\\\"}\" http://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:8003/graphql\nMaana engineering team is currently implementing authentication functionality, which will be required for all clients.\n\nHow to create a graph from a GQL definition ( https://confluence.corp.maana.io/display/RD/Maana+Q+programmatic+interface)\nHow to add instance data\nHow to query instance data\nHow to perform complex queries ( https://confluence.corp.maana.io/display/RD/Technical+Design+Notes#TechnicalDesignNotes-Queries)\nHow to perform search ( https://confluence.corp.maana.io/display/RD/Maana+Q+Search+-+Technical+Design)\n3.Hydrating the model with data\n\nSteps to hydrate a model with data:\n\nCreate a service source with graphql schema. Types must correspond to Kinds on the portal endpoint XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:8003/graphiql. Note that the service can have many Kind definitions.\n\nmutation {\naddServiceSource(input: {\nname: &quot;TestService&quot;,\n\nschema: &quot;type TestKind { \\n id: ID \\n name: String! \\n something: Int! }&quot;\n\n})\n}\nCreating a Service Source will return a Service ID:\n{\n\"data\": {\n&quot;addServiceSource&quot;: &quot;54769aae-2c63-4415-9b34-74e9ceb1d789&quot;\n\n}\n}\nThis ID is used to establish the Service endpoint for subsequent interactions\nXXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:8003/service/54769aae-2c63-4415-9b34-74e9ceb1d789/graphiql\nNote: If the service is re-created by updating definitions, its service ID will change, while the old service will still be available.\n\nAdding a single instance of the kind\n\nmutation {\naddTestKind(input: {\nname: &quot;testname&quot;,\n\nsomething: 42\n\n})\n}\nAn ID is assigned and returned for the instance itself\n{\n\"data\": {\n&quot;addTestKind&quot;: &quot;431f9338-95be-4f89-968c-4f2bb197965c&quot;\n\n}\n}\nOnce the instance data was added, we can query it using:\nquery {\nallTestKinds {\nid\n\nname\n\nsomething\n\n}\n}\n\nAdding multiple data instances simultaneously to a kind\n\nmutation addSomethings {\naddTestKinds(input: [{\nname: &quot;testname2&quot;,\n\nsomething: 45\n\n}, {\nname: &quot;testname3&quot;,\n\nsomething: 43\n\n}\n])\n}\nLarger data volumes should be broken into reasonably sized chunks (i.e. up to 5,000 instances), and submitted sequentially through the endpoint.\nData can be queried using:\nquery {\nallTestKinds {\nid\n\nname\n\nsomething\n\n}\n}\n\n4.Querying a model\n\n4.1.Query through service end points\n\n\n\nThis is the most common way to query the data once ingested in the graph\nquery {\nallTestKinds {\nid\n\nname\n\nsomething\n\n}\n}\n\n\n4.2.Query using global entry points\n\n\n\nThere are more generic ways to read Kinds from a model than through service entry points.\nHowever when using the global entry points (rather than the service entry points), Kinds should be referenced by ID. The IDs for each kind can be obtained from the Service ID by running a query against XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:8003\nHere is an example on how to obtain a Kind IDs from the Service ID:\nquery foo {\nserviceSource(id:\"54769aae-2c63-4415-9b34-74e9ceb1d789\") {\nname\n\nkinds {\n\n  name\n\n  id\n\n}\n\n}\n}\nThe query above should return\n{\n\"data\": {\n&quot;serviceSource&quot;: {\n\n  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;TestService&quot;,\n\n  &quot;kinds&quot;: [\n\n    {\n\n      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;54769aae-2c63-4415-9b34-74e9ceb1d789\\_TestKind&quot;,\n\n      &quot;id&quot;: &quot;a745e4d7-74e9-4023-8f39-bc63d6076326&quot;\n\n    }\n\n  ]\n\n}\n\n}\n}\n\n\n4.3.Query using allinstances\n\n\n\nThis type of query can be used to get instances for a kind in the same format as the query entry point:\nquery {\nallInstances(tenantId:0, kindId:\"a745e4d7-74e9-4023-8f39-bc63d6076326\") {\nrecords {\n\n  STRING\n\n  ID\n\n}\n\n}\n}\n\n\n4.4.Query across kinds\n\n\n\nMore complex queries can be used to more efficiently query across kinds. Many internal services can use this endpoint to reduce the number of DB requests required to fulfil a request.\nHere is an example:\nquery {\nkindDBQuery(kindQuery:{\n\n  kindId:&quot;fcd39416-337c-4566-b5bf-56cc8ff725d2&quot;\n\n  fieldFilters: [{\n\n    op: &quot;==&quot;\n\n    fieldName: &quot;State&quot;\n\n    value: {\n\n      STRING:&quot;WA&quot;\n\n    }\n\n  }]\n\n  and: [{\n\n    kindId:&quot;fcd39416-337c-4566-b5bf-56cc8ff725d2&quot;\n\n    toFieldName:&quot;City&quot;\n\n    fromFieldName: &quot;City&quot;\n\n    fieldFilters:[{\n\n      op: &quot;==&quot;\n\n      fieldName: &quot;Zipcode&quot;\n\n      value: {\n\n        STRING: &quot;98053&quot;\n\n      }\n\n    }]\n\n  }]\n\n}) {\n\n  records {\n\n    ID\n\n    STRING\n\n    INT\n\n    FLOAT\n\n}\n\n}\n}\nThe outer most kind is the type returned, while inner kinds form a DAG where each inner kind constrains its outer kinds instances. The DAG should be considered to be a graph walk, where constraints are applied at each step in the walk, data is returned only if all constraints are true.\nFilters are a collection of {op, fieldname, value} triples that constrain the Kind on which they are applied.\nOperators that can be used:\n\nfor Strings : \"==\" , \"!=\" , \"oneof\"\nfor Numbers (Int and Float) : \"\", \">=\"\n5.Developing knowledge microservices 1. 5.1.Project Setup\n\nstart with a project template in your preferred language\nfollow the instructions on customizing it\nMaana Knowledge Service Templates\nIn an attempt to develop best-practices, code base coherence (learn once), and to ease maintenance burden, we've tried to standardize a number of things that a productive developer should not have to worry about and instead focus on adding real features.\nEvery project should follow a common, consistent pattern in order to reduce the tax imposed by infrastructure, such as web services and middleware, GraphQL services, logging, build, deployment, etc. As such, we recommend always cloning a new project from the Maana Knowledge Service template for your preferred language.\nOnce cloned, perform the customizations recommended in the template's README.md.\nIf your language isn't represented, we'd be happy to work with you to develop a template or just send a pull request to have it included.\n\n\n5.2.Development\n\n\ndefine GraphQL schema for the service endpoint\nimplement appropriate resolvers\nbe client (query, mutate, subscribe) to other Knowledge Services (dependencies)\nstitch together existing services, providing an aggregated endpoint (to simplify client access)\n\n5.3.Packaging\n\n\n\nprepare deployment\nmanaged service : create a docker container\nunmanaged service : not our problem\n\n\n5.4.Adding a knowledge microservice to the MAANA catalogue\n\n\nprepare a service manifest (basically a serialized instance of Kind Service)\nregister the service in the catalog\n\nMaana will:\nintrospect the service\ncreate all the Kinds in KindDB\nalong with boilerplate for Managed Kinds\nthis includes types, queries, mutations, and subscriptions\nregister with CKG?\nboilerplate query and mutation resolvers and event emitters\nschema stitching between synthetic and service-provided resolvers\n\n\nDeveloping knowledge applications\n\n\n7.Troubleshooting\n8.Troubleshooting\n\nDevelopment Scenarios\nlocal: configure and run a local docker machine Maana system and custom services (i.e., a \"deployment\")\nthis is how the Maana R&D work\nemote: mixed environments - a Maana deployment is hosted elsewhere (e,g, Azure) and developing a service locally\nnot supported in v3.0?\nif local and developing an a (locally) deployed service, then \"docker stop\" it and run/debug it manually\nProject Setup\nstart with a project template in your preferred language\nfollow the instructions on customizing it\nDevelop\ndefine GraphQL schema for the service endpoint\nimplement appropriate resolvers\nbe client (query, mutate, subscribe) to other Knowledge Services (dependencies)\nstitch together existing services, providing an aggregated endpoint (to simplify client access)\nPackage\nprepare deployment\nmanaged service : create a docker container\nunmanaged service : not our problem\nCatalog\nprepare a service manifest (basically a serialized instance of Kind Service)\nregister the service in the catalog\nMaana will:\nintrospect the service\ncreate all the Kinds in KindDB\nalong with boilerplate for Managed Kinds\nthis includes types, queries, mutations, and subscriptions\nregister with CKG?\nboilerplate query and mutation resolvers and event emitters\nschema stitching between synthetic and service-provided resolvers\n"},"developer/botactions.html":{"url":"developer/botactions.html","title":"Bot Actions","keywords":"","body":"Bot Actions\nMaana Knowledge Services form a network of GraphQL endpoints, exposing their types, queries, and mutations for direct access, as well as publishing and subscribing to network events.

Capabilities\n\n\n\nFeature\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nImproved system monitoring and logging\nGrafana dashboards have been updated to include more detailed views of key system metrics (see URL http://:4000/). Platform log messages collected via Graylog have been improved to provide more precise information (see URL https://:8443/graylog/ui).\n\n\nSplit Natural language Processing Service\nThe Natural Language Processing Service has been divided into the two independent Natural Language Processing Service and the Fact Extraction Service. This change brings our Cognitive Services more into line with microservice architecture best practices, and provides a foundation for better scalability and extensibility. The Fact Extraction Service holds all mutation related to fact extraction, whereas the Natural Language Processing Service exposes queries and mutations related to named entity tagging.\n\n\nImproved error handling\nBackend system (kindDB) will no longer cache errors. This will prevent situations in which cached errors for previously failed queries caused the system to throw the cached error for new submissions of those queries, instead of retrying.\n\n\nNew text extraction function (A)\nThe Maana \"Text Extractor\" Knowledge Service is able to extract textual information from various file formats (PDF, DOC, DOCX, PPT, PPTX, XLS, XLSX) and to convert files to XHTML.\n\n\n\n(A) Extracted text can be accessed using the following Query (assuming that the service has been triggered via user dropping document on the UI canvas):\n#this query will return all extracted text from the specified document\n#run this query from the Maana Text Extractor service. If not in inventory, search and add to inventory\n\nQuery extractText{\nextractText(\nfile: {\n  id: \"7a47d30a-c102-47cb-bba6-bdd99723d98d\" #your instance id, obtained from the \"document\" Kind\n  name: \"01_Maana_Introduction.pdf\"\n  url: \"https://latest.knowledge.maana.io:8443/downloads/e97737bc-523c-43b4-856b-7648d55bce05/01_Maana_Introduction.pdf\" #obtained from the relevant instance of \"file\" kind\n  status: 200\n    }\n  )\n}\n\n#this query will return all extracted XML from the specified document\n#run this query from the Maana Text Extractor service. If not in inventory, search and add to inventory\n\nQuery extractXHTML{\n  extractText(\n    file: {\n        id: \"7a47d30a-c102-47cb-bba6-bdd99723d98d\" #your instance id, obtained from the \"document\" Kind\n        name: \"01_Maana_Introduction.pdf\"\n        url: \"https://latest.knowledge.maana.io:8443/downloads/e97737bc-523c-43b4-856b-7648d55bce05/01_Maana_Introduction.pdf\" #obtained from the relevant instance of \"file\" kind\n        status: 200\n            }\n        )\n\n    }\n\nFixed Issues\n\n\n\nFixes & improvements\n\n\n\n\nENG-14448 Fixed issue with platform not creating services from CLI related to error message 'Cannot read property 'add' of undefined'.\n\n\nENG-14379 Fixed issue with kind names capitalization and querying.\n\n\nENG-14359 Fixed issue with search crashing platform storage service.\n\n\nENG-14341 Fixed issue with search not returning all results.\n\n\nMiscellaneous cosmetic fixes for the UI.\n\n\nUpdated and added clarification to Q Tutorial documentation on GitHub.\n\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\nIssue Description\n\n\n\n\nIt is a known issue that not all logs will show in in Graylog when a cluster is first deployed, as services may start before the Graylog server (stack) is completely up and running.\n\n\nCurrently the ingestion process using CLI mutations does not perform optimally unless the batch size is set to more than 3000 per chunk, which can be set using the argument -b.\n\n\nWhen large amounts of text data is added through the UI, the platform will become unresponsive. This is the result of the entity extractor bot performing a large number of writes to record the links to entities that it has found in the text. To prevent this, it is necessary to disable the entity extractor bot either by removing its instances following the code block below (B) or by commenting it out in Docker Compose file.\n\n\nUsers cannot currently truly delete instances of kinds from the graph through the UI, though it can be achieved using graphQL mutations.\n\n\nCertain events are not automatically recognized by the UI, and require the user to refresh to see the resultant changes. Uploading a CSV or Image requires a refresh before the hasKind or hasImage Links will be shown within the golden instance node that is created.\n\n\nIt is not possible to edit the type of a kind's field between certain classes of scalar if that kind is populated by instances. For example, if you have uploaded data to a kind that contains a field of type STRING, we do not currently support the action of changing that field to type FLOAT.\n\n\nIf you attempt to upload a large number of records containing bad data (such as badly formatted dates), there is a high-likelihood of system failure. Multiple errors will be raised by each bad record in the batch, and all of these will be thrown back to the loading client at once.\n\n\nIf you attempt to upload a large number of records containing bad data (such as badly formatted dates), there is a high-likelihood of system failure. Multiple errors will be raised by each bad record in the batch, and all of these will be thrown back to the loading client at once.\n\n\nFor security reasons, we are currently not allowing services that are not deployed along with the Q platform to participate in the pub-sub network.\n\n\nThe version of the CLI needs to be at least v3.1.0 to work correctly with v3.1.0 version of the Q platform. The CLI versions can be updated through the Maana Q github repository: Maana Q github repository .\n\n\nIt is not possible to link an ID field to a string type.\n\n\nNon-null fields can report missing value when using mutation of valid field. Auto-generated input types for mutations don't honor NONULL modifier\n\n\n\n(B) Disable the entity extractor bot either by removing its instances:\ndocker service scale _maana-entity-extractor=0\n\n"},"releasenotes/v3-0-5.html":{"url":"releasenotes/v3-0-5.html","title":"v3.0.5","keywords":"","body":"New Features and Capabilities\n\n\n\nFeature\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nHTTPS Encryption\nMaana now supports HTTPS encryption.\n\n\nAuthentication\nMaana Q now requires authentication for all clients that attempt to connect to the Q servers.\n\n\nAzure Storage Crawler Knowledge Service\nWe developed a service that allows users to crawl Azure File and Blob directories, to discover and build a file catalog of the contents.\n\n\nText Extractor\nWe have added a service that extracts all textual information from files of type PDF, DOC, DOCX, PPT, PPTX, XLS, and XLSX, and makes it available in the kind associated with the file in Maana.\n\n\nAdd Files by URL\nMIt is now possible to add a file to Maana through the UI by providing that file's URL, accessed using the \"upload\" icon in the Explorer tab of your workspace.\n\n\nNew Query Graph Filters\nWhen using the Query Graph to filter a kind's instances based on field values, users are now able to use the logical arguments \"is not equal to\" and \"is one of\" in addition to the original \"is equal to\".\n\n\nImproved developer experience\nSupport giving services names, rather than relying on IDs, and support replacing services in-place rather than create new ones.\n\n\n\nFixed Issues\n\n\n\nFeature\n\n\n\n\nUsers now able to upload data sets with more than ~20k records using the CLI without receiving the \"queryResult.forEach is not a function\" error\n\n\nImprovements in the in-node editing experience through the UI\n\n\nLoading data through the CLI no longer throws a FieldMismatch error when the CSV being loaded has empty rows at the end\n\n\nUI stability improvements\n\n\nImprovements to the CKG interactions through CLI\n\n\nImprovements to the Search feature in the UI\n\n\nProper handling of DateTime/Date types\n\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\n\n\nIssue Description\n\n\n\n\nUpon deployment, it is possible for the text extractor service to start in a bad state and require a restart of that service.

Minimally, ensure the endpoint is correct for the Maana endpoint you are using. If you have any questions about the correct Maana endpoint please contact your Maana Solutions Architect Team, or your Internal Maana Administrator\nOptionally, to create a configuration from scratch, create a CKG project and GraphQL endpoint, as in:\ngql init\n? Enter project name (Enter to skip): ckg\n? Local schema file path: ckg.graphql\n? Endpoint URL (Enter to skip): https://stable.knowledge.maana.io:8443/graphql\n? Name of this endpoint, for e.g. default, dev, prod: (default)\n? Subscription URL (Enter to skip):\n? Do you want to add other endpoints? No\n? What format do you want to save your config in? JSON\n\nAbout to write to /home/me/maana/training/.graphqlconfig:\n\n{\n  \"projects\": {\n    \"ckg\": {\n      \"schemaPath\": \"ckg.graphql\",\n      \"extensions\": {\n        \"endpoints\": {\n          \"default\": \"https://stable.knowledge.maana.io:8443/graphql\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n? Is this ok? Yes\n\n\nAuthentication with Maana\nMaana endpoints require a valid (authenticated) user in order to prevent unauthorized access. You must first obtain a token and the update the configuration to use the token by updating the endpoint configuration.\nMaana Q v3.0.5\n\nLogin to the Maana Knowledge Portal\nClick on your user icon and select your profile\nAt the bottom of the profile page click the 'Get CLI Authentication Token' button\nLogin Again (For Enhanced Security)\nCopy the generated auth token that shows up below the button\n\n\n\nIn the terminal add an environment variable for the auth token\n\n# *nix based systems\nexport AUTH_TOKEN_ENV=\n\nrem windows command line\nset AUTH_TOKEN_ENV=\n\n# windows power shell\n$Env:AUTH_TOKEN_ENV = \"\"\n\n\nMaana Q v3.1.0 and later\nAfter creating a new .graphqlconfig file connecting to a Maana API endpoint:\n\nLogin to the Maana Knowledge Portal\nClick on your user icon and select your profile\nAt the bottom of the profile page click the 'Get CLI Authentication Token' button\nGo through the login process (again)\nCopy the generated auth token that shows up below the button\nIn the terminal run gql msignin and when asked paste the Authentication Token into the prompt\n\n  $ gql msignin\n\n\n\nRun gql menv --shell  in the current terminal window to run authenticated GraphQL calls.\n\nExample: Run gql menv --shell bash if you are using bash$ gql menv --shell bash\n\n\nYou will see output similar to:export MAANA_AUTH_TOKEN=\n# Run this command to configure your shell\n# eval $(gql menv --shell bash)\n\n\nNow run eval $(gql menv --shell bash) like it asks you at the bottom of the outputeval $(gql menv --shell bash)\n\n\n\n\nRun gql ping to test out that the authentication works (you will get an error if it did not)\n  gql ping\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nWhen you add another project to your .graphqlconfig file you can run gql maddheaders --project  to add the headers to the new project.\nWhen you want to run the CLI against the Maana API in a different terminal window you will need to run gql env again.\nIf your authentication token expires you can run gql mrefreshauth to refresh the authentication token, when the Maana API is configured to allow the refreshing of authentication tokens.\n\nCreate the Service\nThe domain model for the tutorial has already been created: model.gql. This GraphQL SDL file contains only the types we care about: Well, Location, DrillingReport, DrillingProblem, ...\nWe would like to have Maana completely manage these types, creating the boilerplate queries, mutations, and subscriptions covering the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.\nWe can use the GraphQL CLI with the Maana plugin command: maddsvc (\"add service\"):\n  Navigate to the root directory drill_prob path of the Maana-Q-Training:\n  $ cd drill_prob\n  $ pwd\n    /Q-tutorials/drill_prob\n\ngql maddsvc \"Drillng Problems\" -s model.gql -p ckg\nUsing endpoint default: {\"url\":\"https://qtraining01.knowledge.maana.io:8443/graphql\"}\nRead file: model.gql size: 483\nSending query:\n\n      mutation addServiceSource($input: AddServiceSourceInput!) {\n        addServiceSource(input: $input)\n      }\n\n✔ Call succeeded:\n{\"addServiceSource\":\"50d759d5-983d-4ea2-9773-20077c9b823e\"}\n\n\nUpdate the Config\nThe included .graphqlconfig already contains a project, dp, that specified the schema file and endpoint for this service.

This is a user created sub-section of the Knowledge Graph that is made up of kinds and sources that they decide are important to model their domain. This will likely be the union (collected set) of kinds from a bunch of knowledge models, but is likely to be more than only what is in the KMs.\nE\nElements\nThe items that make up Maana. See Knowledge Models, Domain Models, Kinds, Knowledge Graph, Presentation View, Join Assists and Similarity Assist.\nEntity\nA unique instance of a Kind with data from the indexes mapped into its Properties. Kinds are sets of unique Entities. Examples of entities related to the People concept: age, sex, height, weight, etc.\nEntity Conflation\nThe process of merging two or more sets of data that represent a single Entity into a single unified set of data representing that Entity.\nEntity Extraction\nThe process of reading a set of Records or Entities, generating a set of new Entities and indexing the new Entities directly against a Kind. Entity Extraction relies on Entity Resolution and potentially Entity Conflation. In the case where Entity Extraction is generating Entities from only part of a source Schema/Kind, the Entity Extraction process will also generate Entity References between the source Record / Entity and the newly created Entity.\nEntity Reference\nA named and indexed relationship between a source Record/Entity and an Entity.\nEntity Resolution\nThe process of using Field or Property data believed to be a reference to an Entity (e.g. an id or name) and resolving it to a specific Entity. Often the goal will be to subsequently replace or augment the Field / Property that contains the Entity identifiers with an Entity Reference connecting the source Record/Entity to the resolved Entity. However, there may also the need to allow Entity Resolution simply to visualize the details of an Entity.\nESG ™ (Emergent Semantic Graph)\nThe ESG is a graph representation of the structure of crawled and indexed data along with any enrichments that have been made to the data either through human intervention (i.e. curation) or from the output of machine learning processes run across the data (i.e. classification and mining). Data is not stored in the ESG, only a representation of the data structure and metadata useful to the connection, navigation, and display of indexed data.\nETL (Extract, Transform, Load)\nETL is a general description of a process where some tool Extracts data from homogeneous or heterogeneous data sources, Transforms the data for storing it in proper format or structure for querying and analysis purposes and Loads it into the final target (e.g. database). Maana does not include ETL capabilities as part of the core platform. This process is assumed to be carried out external to the Maana platform, with the final Load step being the pushing of data into Maana through Maana’s API layer. The Load step in ETL is equivalent to the Crawl process in Maana terminology.\nExample (statistics and ml)\nAn example is a single row or single complete tuple of information according to some defined set of variables in data table/ matrix/ array.

For example a featurizer might take a temperature in string form, in either Fahrenheit or Celsius, and covert it to a binary 1.0 if it is greater than 100C, or 0.0 if not. The vector may be dense or sparse. An example of a sparse feature vector is a map from words to counts of those word occurring in some body of text (known as a bag of words model).\nFeature Model\nA compact representation of Maana Software elements.\nFeaturization\nThe process of transforming data from its raw form into a form that useful for a machine learning algorithm. A featurization consists of an ordered collection of one or more Featurizers. If one or more of the Features in this collection outputs a sparse vector then the Featurization must also output a sparse vector.\nFeaturizer\nA function f: X --> Rn, where X is a set of objects of some type. A featurizer is an implementation of a feature.\nField\nWhen Maana Crawls a source of data, it models the structure of the source in the ESG as a Schema with a set of Fields. The Schema represents the top level container of data (e.g. database table, XML document, JSON object, CSV file), and the Fields are the substructure within that container (e.g. database table columns, XML elements, JSON properties, CSV of spreadsheet columns).\nField Analyzer\nA process that runs across data indexed against a Field to generate statistics and probabilistic classifications about the Field. For example, a Field could be classified as a Person Name, Company Name, or Distance Measure. The Field Analyzer is extensible through the installation of purpose specific classifiers.\nFlume\nA distributed, reliable, and available service for efficiently moving large amounts of data as the data is produced.

Hue aggregates several applications which are collected into a desktop-like environment and delivered as a Web application that requires no client installation by individual users.\nI\nIndependent Variable\nIndependent variables are the set of variables assumed to explain some observed outcome. (It's important to note that correlation does not imply causation, so while changes in a set of variables may be associated with an observed change in a dependent variable, that DOES NOT mean that the changes in the set of predictors CAUSED the change in the outcome, only that they changed together in a quantifiable way.) Example: The price of gas (Y - the dependent variable) is determined by a set of X including Oil Supply and Oil Demand. In this example the independent variables are Oil Supply and Oil Demand.\nIndexed Join\nA Join where the instance level connections between the participating Schema Field values have been written to the Join Index. This improves the speed at which the query engine can resolve the Join and also allows for arbitrary mappings between instance values because no algorithm is needed to calculate the mapping at runtime.\nInner Join\nProduces a set of records that match in both tables according to a common key.\nInstance\nA particular set of values for entities within a concept. example of a concept, or an element of the set of things described by a concept e.g. Maana is an instance of the concept Company.

Appending information from one set of information to another.\nJoin Assist\ndefinition?\nK\nKey Discovery\nA process that runs across Field data and assigns a probabilistic classification to the Field describing the platforms confidence in whether the Field is a Primary Key or Foreign Key.\nKinds\nKinds are collections of unique things, such as concepts people typically think about on a daily basis (e.g. people, movies, wells, etc.) Every business domain may have its own set of Kinds important to that domain. Kinds are user-defined and mapped onto the indexed data, which allows generating a set of meaningful entities out of raw, indexed data via Search.\nKind Mapping\nHow the entities in a Kind map onto a source Schema or a Query Node. Through multiple Kind Mappings, entities for a single Kind can be sourced from different Schemas and Query Nodes. Each Kind mapping for a Kind specifies how the entities are mapped to properties via specific property mappings.\nKnowledge Application\nA software application that addresses a Use Case when operating on and in connection with the Maana Software, is developed using the Maana Knowledge Platform, and contains one or more Models and a user interface.\nKnowledge Assistant\ndefinition?\nKnowledge Bots\nMaana Q includes several Knowledge Bots (microservices), which automate many of the computational modeling data scientists perform - such as field classification, entity recognition and supervised machine learning.

It enables the user to build machine-learning libraries that are scalable to “reasonably large” datasets, making the building of building intelligent applications easier and faster.\nMaterialization\nThe indexing of data directly against Kinds.\nMaterialized Entity\nMaterialized Kinds do not map onto a Schema, instead having consolidated data indexed directly against the Kind Properties (e.g. there is only one “Actor” Harrison Ford although 30 instances of Harrison Ford may exist across multiple movies in the raw data).\nMaterialized Kind\nA Kind that does not map to an underlying Schema but instead has data indexed directly against its Properties. The result of Entity Extraction is a Materialized Kind, but it is also possible for data to be indexed directly against a Kind during crawl.\nMicroservices\nAn architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely-coupled, single-function services with well-defined interfaces. services are processes that communicate with each other over a network in order to fulfill a goal using technology-agnostic protocols such as HTTP. It enables the continuous delivery/deployment of large, complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.\nMID\nCommon abbreviation of Model ID. Model ID (MID):A structure used throughout the Maana platform to refer to an instance of indexed data. The MID consists of a PID and an ordered array of Keys. The PID identifies the ESG Node where the data belongs and Key array contains one Key for each segment of the ESG Path represented by the PID.\nMiner\nCode that uses the Maana APIs to process data.

In Maana, users model data by creating Kinds and mapping their Properties to indexed data (i.e. to Schema Fields). Once data has been modeled as Kinds, the associated data can more easily be surfaced in Search results.\nMutation\nA GraphQL mutation performs operations such as CREATE, UPDATE and DELETE. Queries do not change data, a mutation does.\nN\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER)\nthe location, classification, and extraction of ngrams or text elements that are expected to identify or refer to Entities. Entity Resolution would typically follow Named Entity Recognition to find the actual Entity referenced.\nNamed Relation\nThese allow users to create custom relationships between nodes in the ESG. These can be used by the user for any purpose, but will surface most visibly when Maana is displaying related data in search results. For example, for the two Kinds Employee and Company, the Named Relation might be “works for”.\nNamespace\nESG nodes that allow users to create a hierarchical structure (like directories in a file system) into which Schemas and Kinds can be organized.\nNode\nSee Kind.\nNormalize (database users)\nThe process of minimizing data redundancy across data sets/ data tables/ or within a relational database\nNormalize (statistics and ml)\nThe process of transforming continuous real variables such that they are centered and scaled by some measure of dispersion.

A command line client is also available that allows remote administration and management of workflows within the Oozie server.\nP\nP-Value\nSuppose an analyst has observed a random variable X, and wants to know if, on average x is different than some other value (for example -the mean of a different variable, zero, or some other fixed value - we'll call it target value). To answer that question we need the p - value. The p value tells us the probability that an observed set of values came from a distribution with a mean of the target value and we purely by cosmic chance observed a set of values where the mean was different. There are two critical points to remember about the p - value: 1. It's only meaningful in the context of a question comparing two values. 2. Smaller p values are better.\nPage\nA page is a area of the canvas that displays a slot at 100% or broken up into various combinations of 50% and 25% increments. There are two types of pages: Primary and Secondary.\nPath\nThe fully qualified name of an ESG node representing where the node (Namespace, Schema, Field, Kind, Property, etc.) fits in the hierarchical naming structure.\nPID\nThe ESG can be seen as a hierarchical namespace (like directories in a filesystem) where interior nodes are simply name disambiguators (e.g., /Maana/, /GE/, /Chevron/) and outer (but not leaf) nodes represent tables or objects from XML/JSON and leaf nodes represent fields, or columns. Any node, therefore, can be reached using a path expression which is simply a set of names separated by ’/’-s. These paths are internally represented using a 64-bit mathematical hash called a Path Identifier (PID).\nPig\nEnables you to analyze large amounts of data using Pig’s query language called Pig Latin. Pig Latin queries run in a distributed way on a Hadoop cluster.\nPOC\nProof of concept.\nPredictive Models\nUses statistics to predict outcomes.

Thus, a process model is a description of a process at the type level. Since the process model is at the type level, a process is an instantiation of it.\nProperty\nProperties are the data fields that define Kinds. Properties of Kinds are mapped to Fields in the underlying Schema.\nProvenance\nProvenance is information about entities, activities, and people involved in producing a piece of data or thing, which can be used to form assessments about its quality, reliability or trustworthiness.\nPublishers\nSenders of messages in a publish–subscribe messaging pattern.\nPub-Sub Standard\nEnables microservices to be aware of events and take action in reaction to those events. Publish–subscribe is a messaging pattern where senders of messages - called publishers - do not program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers - called subscribers - but instead categorize published messages into classes without knowledge of which subscribers, if any, there may be. Similarly, subscribers express interest in one or more classes and only receive messages that are of interest, without knowledge of which publishers, if any, there are.\nQ\nQuery Node\nAn Emergent Semantic Graph (ESG) node that contains a query that is executed whenever the data for the node is retrieved. Mapping a Kind to a Query Node (through a Kind Mapping) enables the creation of Kinds that span multiple Schemas and/or apply filters to the source Schema. Query Nodes should not be used if the output needs to be searchable, as Query Node results are temporary.\nQueries\nA GraphQL query performs the READ operation (in a GraphQL API). In contrast, a GraphQL mutation performs other operations as well, such as CREATE, UPDATE and DELETE. This simply means that queries don't change data, a mutation does.\nR\nRaw Data Kind\nA raw data Kind represents files uploaded to Maana and their corresponding metadata.\nReconciliation Assist\nThe ability to reconcile any 2 Kinds or 2 Properties; outputs are: 3 things returned plus any required Kinds. TODO –expand definition\nRecord\nA Record is an instance of a Schema with data mapped into its Fields.\nRefinement\nThe act of cleaning up data and transforming it from one format to another. E.g. names in a table may be listed in various formats (First Last vs. Last, First) and require standardization to help improve usability.\nRelations\nConnections /dependencies that can be established between 2 kinds. They can be suggested automatically by the system when new files are loaded into MAANA or manually created by the user.\nRelated Kind\nThere are three ways for Kinds to be related to each other and surfaced to the user as a Related Kind: through a shared Property, through an indexed Join or through a Named Relation.\nRelation\nA relation or relationship, in the context of databases, is a situation that exists between two relational database tables when one table has a foreign key that references the primary key of the other table. Relationships allow relational databases to split and store data in different tables, while linking disparate data items.\nRelational Join\nA traditional relation join modeled in Maana, by creating a connection between a Field that represents the Foreign Key and a Field represents the Primary Key.\nResult\nmeans the product/output of analysis performed by the Maana Software on Customer Data, and any reports containing such analysis.\nRuntime Join\nA Join where the connections between Record Field Values is resolved on demand at query time, as opposed to being resolved and stored at Join creation time, which is the case with Indexed Joins. Runtime Joins may also be referred to as Dynamic Joins.\nS\nScenario\nScenarios are variations of the more general Use Case documented related to specific user interactions in Maana. For example, two scenarios for Edit Class are: add Class to a single Field and add Class to multiple Fields.\nSchema\nThe Schema is a view of how the source data was organized when presented to Maana for indexing. When Maana crawls data, it models the structure of the source in the ESG as a Schema with a set of Fields.\nSchema View\nWhen Maana crawls a source of data, such as a csv, mdb, or xml file, it models the structure of the file in the ESG as a Schema with a set of Fields. The structure is placed at a location in the namespace defined by the person crawling the data. The structure of Kinds by users is also stored in the ESG, isolated in a separate part of the namespace hierarchy.\nScrolling\nA vertical or horizontal bar located on the far right or bottom of a page or slot that allows the user to move either the page or the slot's viewing area up, down, left, or right. Maana supports two types of scrolling: Page Scrolling and Slot Scrolling\nSearch\ndefinition?\nSearch and Query (SAQ)\ndefinition?\nSimilarity Assist\ndefinition?\nSimilarity\nSimilarity is the measure of how much alike two data objects are. Similarity in a data mining context is usually described as a distance with dimensions representing features of the objects.\nSlot\nA container that appears on the Canvas that houses an element (KM, DM, PV, that is dragged and dropped to the canvas from the side panel or Search.\nSlot Scrolling\nThe ability to scroll the contents of a slot up or down/left or right. This is supported everywhere a slot is supported (Workspace and Magnify Mode and all slot types and sizes).\nSnappy\nA compression/decompression library. For Maana V2.0, you do not need to install Snappy if you are already using the native library, but you do need to configure it; see Snappy Installation for more information.\nSource Model\ndefinition?\nSqoop\nA tool that imports data from relational databases into Hadoop clusters. Using JDBC to interface with databases, Sqoop imports the contents of tables into a Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and generates Java classes that enable users to interpret the table’s schema. Sqoop can also export records from HDFS to a relational database.\nSqoop 2\nA server-based tool for transferring data between Hadoop and relational databases. You can use Sqoop 2 to import data from a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL or Oracle into the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), transform the data with Hadoop MapReduce, and then export it back into an RDBMS.\nStatistical Model\nStatistical modeling is a simplified, mathematically-formalized way to approximate reality (i.e. what generates your data) and optionally to make predictions from this approximation. The statistical model is the mathematical equation that is used.\nStatistical Vizualizations+a169\ndefinition?\nString\nString is any arbitrary length character sequence and is the most generic representation. A String could look like: “the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog”, “90210”,”CA”, “jill smith”, \"TCO\", \"aosofiywj fq9h\" , \"49583736Q3004PIJG074\", \"mdkapufpau”\nStructural Model\ndefinition?\nSubscribers\nReceivers of messages in a publish–subscribe messaging pattern.\nSystem Bus\nA system bus is a single computer bus that connects the major components of a computer system, combining the functions of a data bus to carry information, an address bus to determine where it should be sent, and a control bus to determine its operation.\nSystem Kind\nThe structural elements of the ESG depicted as Kinds when they are surfaced in Query results, allowing them to be used in the same way as user generated Kinds. System Kinds include, Schema, Field, Type, Class, Kind, Property, join, Entity Reference, Kind Reference, Named Relation.\nT\nTab\nis represents one of three things in Maana: The landing page (contains flag icon), a workspace (contains the name of the workspace) and a new tab, (plus sign) When there's more Workspaces on the page than can be displayed within the space provided, the plus sign icon will update to include a down arrow to show an extended menu.\nTenant\ndefinition?\nTraining Example Pair\ndefinition?\nTuple\nTuples are unordered sets of known values with names. In mathematics, a tuple is a finite ordered list (sequence) of elements.\nType\nThe set of fundamental data types in Maana are: Integer, Floating Point, String and Date/Time. Types are associated with Fields in the form of a probabilistic score that the Field is of the given Type based on the values that have been written to the Field. Types are also associated with Properties to identify the Type a Field must have to be considered for machine assisted mapping to that containing Kind.\nText\nText indicates that a string is expected to be some form of natural language and can be processed as such (entity/fact extraction, association network, word embeddings, etc.) Text is a stronger classification of a string (i.e., it has more meaning - \"Paul Allen\", is interpreted by the classifier as a person's name).\nU\nUAT (User Acceptance Testing)\nUser Acceptance Testing. Typically, the final testing phase in a software development process where software is tested by the intended audience for functionality.\nUnnamed Relations\nTwo (or more) Kinds can become related when an implicit link between them is created when a Relational Join is formed between at least two Schema that have been mapped to those Kinds.\nUse Case\nThe business problem being faced by Customer that has the potential to be addressed with the Maana Knowledge Platform.\nThese are user interactions in Maana (i.e. functionality), which include variations (called “scenarios”) on actions such as Browse, Edit, Add, Read, Delete, Search, etc.\nUX Storyboard\nThe interaction between the customer and the core platform to find and filter information as well as optionally request ranked results from the custom answer service through custom UI\nV\nValues\nA particular size, measure, number of an entity. Value example: 40.\nView (Grid)\nFor immediate numbers of items or raw records, Maana will default to a familiar grid view, allowing the user to sort, search, and filter locally. Pagination may be implemented, in case large data sets are involved.\nView (Item)\n(formerly called Entity View) If the results represent a single entity, Maana will display Item cards, providing direct access to information about each item. This is a profile view.\nView (Multi-item)\nSame as Item view; however, the user will be able to easily select from a list of Items (carousel, list, etc.) one Item to view in detail.\nView (Summary)\nFor larger result sets, Maana displays a Summary View, presenting a set of data visualizations representing the aggregate values across the result set and allowing the user to see trends and patterns in the data.\nW\nWhirr\nProvides a fast way to run cloud services.\nWorkspace\nA container that groups together collections of elements from the Knowledge Graph. A workspace is a dedicated place within the MAANA portal where a user can build, visualize and explore a computational knowledge graph.\nWorkspace Aode\nOne of two modes that the canvas supports. Workspace mode allows the customer to show and unlimited number of slots at a time.\nX\nY\nZ\nZookeeper\nA highly reliable and available service that provides coordination between distributed processes.\n"},"contact.html":{"url":"contact.html","title":"Contact","keywords":"","body":"Contact\nGetting Super Powers\nBecoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:\n$ give me super-powers\nOnce you're strong enough, save the world:\n// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry\necho 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'\n"},"releasenotes/v3-1-0.html":{"url":"releasenotes/v3-1-0.html","title":"v3.1.0","keywords":"","body":"New Features And Capabilities\n"}}}
