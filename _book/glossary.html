Entity Extraction relies on Entity Resolution and potentially Entity Conflation. In the case where Entity Extraction is generating Entities from only part of <a href="glossary.html#a" class="glossary-term" title="">a</a> source Schema/Kind, the Entity Extraction process will also generate Entity References between the source Record / Entity and the newly created Entity.</p>
<h3 id="entity-reference">Entity Reference</h3>

Maana does not include ETL capabilities as part of the core platform. This process is assumed to be carried out external to the Maana platform, with the final Load step being the pushing of data into Maana through Maana&#x2019;<a href="glossary.html#s" class="glossary-term" title="">s</a> API layer. The Load step in ETL is equivalent to the Crawl process in Maana terminology.</p>

<p>Suppose an analyst has observed <a href="glossary.html#a" class="glossary-term" title="">a</a> random variable <a href="glossary.html#x" class="glossary-term" title="">X</a>, and wants to know if, on average <a href="glossary.html#x" class="glossary-term" title="">x</a> is different than some other value (for example -the mean of <a href="glossary.html#a" class="glossary-term" title="">a</a> different variable, zero, or some other fixed value - we&apos;ll call it target value). To answer that question we need the <a href="glossary.html#p" class="glossary-term" title="">p</a> - value. The <a href="glossary.html#p" class="glossary-term" title="">p</a> value tells us the probability that an observed set of values came from <a href="glossary.html#a" class="glossary-term" title="">a</a> distribution with <a href="glossary.html#a" class="glossary-term" title="">a</a> mean of the target value and we purely by cosmic chance observed <a href="glossary.html#a" class="glossary-term" title="">a</a> set of values where the mean was different.

<h3 id="process-model">Process Model</h3>
<p>Process models are processes of the same nature that are classified together into <a href="glossary.html#a" class="glossary-term" title="">a</a> model. Thus, <a href="glossary.html#a" class="glossary-term" title="">a</a> process model is <a href="glossary.html#a" class="glossary-term" title="">a</a> description of <a href="glossary.html#a" class="glossary-term" title="">a</a> process at the type level. Since the process model is at the type level, <a href="glossary.html#a" class="glossary-term" title="">a</a> process is an instantiation of it.</p>
<h3 id="property">Property</h3>
<p>Properties are the data fields that define Kinds. Properties of Kinds are mapped to Fields in the underlying Schema.</p>
